## Known Limitations and/or Workarounds
+ Does not support multiple users per-machine
+ Due to [#118612](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/118612), the GNOME Extension `Fly Pie` has been disabled for the time-being
+ Currently if `hardware.sane` is enabled then printing services for Canon Pixma series printers does not work, hence it is left disabled

## Manually Applied Configuration
+ Virtual Machine Management
+ WINE Applications
