### Virtual Machines
Virtualisation is done using `qemu-kvm` and `libvirt`. Preferred GUI is `virt-manager`. For VFI/O, you can use `hardware.passthrough` to specify the devices you want to pass through to the VM (you can use [`scripts/pci.sh`](../../../scripts/pci.sh) to find the IDs). A Windows VM is declaratively installed and configured making use of the [WFVM](https://git.m-labs.hk/M-Labs/wfvm) Project. Use `nix-build windows.nix` to build the image
