# Caution

**Important:** Nix >= 2.4

It is not recommended to use NixOS if you are a beginner just starting out, without acquaintance with either the command-line or functional programming languages, since the learning curve is steep, debugging issues is difficult, documentation is shallow, and the effort required/time spent isn't worth the hassle for a novice/casual user
